# Handwritten mathematical symbols dataset

This dataset is forked from [Detexify dataset](https://github.com/kirel/detexify-data).
The original data is provided in SQL form. I have converted each record into a numpy array of 32x32, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRBCAcUrBwEfvrK84BAPPxhsPO3It4HC/view?usp=sharing).

I also did some processing for model training (convert to `float32`, add channel dimension, normalization) and uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PNA95QKiyhWkfntP4BtpEsDVvktY0Fr7/view?usp=sharing).
